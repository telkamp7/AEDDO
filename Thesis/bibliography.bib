 abstract = {Outbreaks of infectious diseases must be detected early for effective control measures to be introduced. When dealing with large amounts of data, automated procedures can usefully supplement traditional surveillance methods, provided that the wide variety of patterns and frequencies of infections are taken into account. This paper describes a robust system developed to process weekly reports of infections received at the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. A simple regression algorithm is used to calculate suitable thresholds. Organisms exceeding their threshold are then flagged for further investigation.},

abstract  = {In England and Wales, a large-scale multiple statistical
            surveillance system for infectious disease outbreaks has been in
            operation for nearly two decades. This system uses a robust
            quasi-Poisson regression algorithm to identify abberrances in
            weekly counts of isolates reported to the Health Protection
            Agency. In this paper, we review the performance of the system
            with a view to reducing the number of false reports, while
            retaining good power to detect genuine outbreaks. We undertook
            extensive simulations to evaluate the existing system in a range
            of contrasting scenarios. We suggest several improvements
            relating to the treatment of trends, seasonality, re-weighting
            of baselines and error structure. We validate these results by
            running the existing and proposed new systems in parallel on
            real data. We find that the new system greatly reduces the
            number of alarms while maintaining good overall performance and
            in some instances increasing the sensitivity.},

 abstract={Public health surveillance aims at lessening disease burden by, e.g., timely recognizing emerging outbreaks in case of infectious diseases. Seen from a statistical perspective, this implies the use of appropriate methods for monitoring time series of aggregated case reports. This paper presents the tools for such automatic aberration detection offered by the R package surveillance. We introduce the functionalities for the visualization, modeling and monitoring of surveillance time series. With respect to modeling we focus on univariate time series modeling based on generalized linear models (GLMs), multivariate GLMs, generalized additive models and generalized additive models for location, shape and scale. Applications of such modeling include illustrating implementational improvements and extensions of the well-known Farrington algorithm, e.g., by spline-modeling or by treating it in a Bayesian context. Furthermore, we look at categorical time series and address overdispersion using beta-binomial or Dirichlet-multinomial modeling. With respect to monitoring we consider detectors based on either a Shewhart-like single timepoint comparison between the observed count and the predictive distribution or by likelihoodratio based cumulative sum methods. Finally, we illustrate how surveillance can support aberration detection in practice by integrating it into the monitoring workflow of a public health institution. Altogether, the present article shows how well surveillance can support automatic aberration detection in a public health surveillance context.},

abstract = {Accurate real-time tracking of influenza outbreaks helps public health officials make timely and meaningful decisions that could save lives. We propose an influenza tracking model, ARGO (AutoRegression with GOogle search data), that uses publicly available online search data. In addition to having a rigorous statistical foundation, ARGO outperforms all previously available Google-search–based tracking models, including the latest version of Google Flu Trends, even though it uses only low-quality search data as input from publicly available Google Trends and Google Correlate websites. ARGO not only incorporates the seasonality in influenza epidemics but also captures changes in people’s online search behavior over time. ARGO is also flexible, self-correcting, robust, and scalable, making it a potentially powerful tool that can be used for real-time tracking of other social events at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions.}

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(4), 546–558. Background  Timely influenza surveillance is important to monitor influenza epidemics. Objectives  (i) To calculate the epidemic threshold for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in 19 countries, as well as the thresholds for different levels of intensity. (ii) To evaluate the performance of these thresholds. Methods  The moving epidemic method (MEM) has been developed to determine the baseline influenza activity and an epidemic threshold. False alerts, detection lags and timeliness of the detection of epidemics were calculated. The performance was evaluated using a cross-validation procedure. Results  The overall sensitivity of the MEM threshold was 71·8\% and the specificity was 95·5\%. The median of the timeliness was 1 week (range: 0–4·5). Conclusions  The method produced a robust and specific signal to detect influenza epidemics. The good balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the epidemic threshold to detect seasonal epidemics and avoid false alerts has advantages for public health purposes. This method may serve as standard to define the start of the annual influenza epidemic in countries in Europe.},

abstract = {Objectives Although influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) surveillance are well established in Europe, the comparability of intensity among countries and seasons remains an unresolved challenge. The objective is to compare the intensity of ILI and ARI in some European countries. Design and setting Weekly ILI and ARI incidence rates and proportion of primary care consultations were modeled in 28 countries for the 1996/1997–2013/2014 seasons using the moving epidemic method (MEM). We calculated the epidemic threshold and three intensity thresholds, which delimit five intensity levels: baseline, low, medium, high, and very high. The intensity of 2013/2014 season is described and compared by country. Results The lowest ILI epidemic thresholds appeared in Sweden and Estonia (below 10 cases per 100 000) and the highest in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, and Slovakia (above 100 per 100 000). The 2009/2010 season was the most intense, with 35\% of the countries showing high or very high intensity levels. The European epidemic period in season 2013/2014 started in January 2014 in Spain, Poland, and Greece. The intensity was between low and medium and only Greece reached the high intensity level, in weeks 7 to 9/2014. Some countries remained at the baseline level throughout the entire surveillance period. Conclusions Epidemic and intensity thresholds varied by country. Influenza-like illnesses and ARI levels normalized by MEM in 2013/2014 showed that the intensity of the season in Europe was between low and medium in most of the countries. Comparing intensity among seasons or countries is essential for understanding patterns in seasonal epidemics. An automated standardized model for comparison should be implemented at national and international levels.},

We evaluated three alternative statistical approaches where alert thresholds are based on recent data in both temperate and subtropical regions.Methods We compared time series, regression, and cumulative sum (CUSUM) models on empirical data from Hong Kong and the US using a composite index (range = 0–1) consisting of the key outcomes of sensitivity, specificity, and time to detection (lag). The index was calculated based on alarms generated within the first 2 or 4 weeks of the peak season.Results We found that the time series model was optimal in the Hong Kong setting, while both the time series and CUSUM models worked equally well on US data. For alarms generated within the first 2 weeks (4 weeks) of the peak season in Hong Kong, the maximum values of the index were: time series 0.77 (0.86); regression 0.75 (0.82); CUSUM 0.56 (0.75). In the US data the maximum values of the index were: time series 0.81 (0.95); regression 0.81 (0.91); CUSUM 0.90 (0.94).Conclusions Automated influenza surveillance methods based on short-term data, including time series and CUSUM models, can generate sensitive, specific, and timely alerts, and can offer a useful alternative to Serfling-like methods that rely on long-term, historically based thresholds.}",

It is important that any unusual increase of reported cases should be detected as rapidly as possible. Reliable forecasts based on a suitable model of the temporal structure of a pathological indicator are necessary for the elaboration of an alert threshold. We first discuss the specific problems associated with the identification and the estimation of the temporal structure of indicators of infectious diseases when they present both epidemic peaks and an underlying stationary structure. Then we consider how an alert threshold can be defined. Our application concerns infections caused by S. bovismorbificans in France for which an alert threshold is constructed and tested both retrospectively and prospectively.},

One of the functions of surveillance is to detect outbreaks but it could be argued that this is one of the weaker aspects of routine surveillance at present. This paper describes a technique which might meet this surveillance need. The CuSum technique allows rapid measurement of change from expected values based on historical data. It is very simple and seems to be a highly sensitive technique which can signal the need for further scrutiny of the data and/or for public health action, long before a change in incidence is apparent from raw data. This is particularly true for low-incidence infections where large fluctuations can make interpretation difficult. CuSums represent a potentially useful adjunct to other surveillance methods in infection control.}
