\chapter{Case studies}

This chapter presents the findings obtained from applying both the state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithm and the novel outbreak detection algorithm to the subset of diseases examined in this master's thesis. To demonstrate the practical application of these algorithms, a comprehensive case study focused on STEC will be presented as the primary focus. The results of the remaining case studies will be presented in a more concise manner to maintain reader engagement. However, for a complete collection of related figures and tables, please refer to Appendix \@ref(FigAndTabCaseStudy).

It is widely recognized that effective monitoring of a surveillance time series necessitates accurate modeling of the time series prior to assessing aberrations. Therefore, the performance of these algorithms in identifying outbreaks within the selected diseases will be thoroughly discussed and analyzed. Both the state-of-the-art algorithms and the novel algorithms take into account trends and seasonality, which will be addressed in the analysis.

Furthermore, a comprehensive comparative analysis will be conducted to provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of both the state-of-the-art algorithms and, more importantly, the novel algorithms.

For a detailed presentation of the data used to generate these results, please refer to Chapter \@ref(Dataset).

\section{Shiga toxin (verotoxin)-producing \textit{Escherichia coli}}

The initial analysis focuses on STEC. The data set comprises monthly counts of Danish STEC cases, denoted as $y_{it}$, where $i=1,\dots,6$ represents the six age groups and $t=1,\dots,T$ represents the time period of $T=180$ months starting in 2008. The first step involves applying the state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithms to identify potential outbreaks in the time series.

Following that, the novel outbreak detection algorithm is utilized, and different models for the fixed effects are proposed. Both the hierarchical Poisson Normal model and the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model is considered for the modeling framework. The performance of these models is compared using the average logarithmic score, $\bar{S}(G,y)$, to determine the most appropriate model for further analysis.

\subsection{Applying the state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithm to Shiga toxin (verotoxin)-producing \textit{Escherichia coli}}

To investigate outbreak detection, the Farrington method and the Noufaily method, as described in Section \@ref(StateOfTheArt), are initially explored. These methods can be implemented using the `farringtonFlexible` function, which is available in the R package called \textbf{surveillance}. The specific `control` arguments for each method can be found in Appendix \@ref(controlsStateOfTheArt).

For this analysis, the reference values are based on data collected from January 2008 to February 2011. Subsequently, surveillance is performed using the data spanning from March 2011 to December 2022. The resulting time series is visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:CompareStateOfTheArtSTEC).

Monitored by (left) Farrington and (right) Noufaily method. Reference data for the estimation of model parameters from January 2008 to March 2011 (grey area). Threshold (dashed line) is computed for observations timepoints outside reference data. Alarm triggered (dark color) if observations exceeds threshold.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:CompareStateOfTheArtSTEC) displays multiple alarms for both the Farrington method and the Noufaily method. The Farrington method generates a total of `r STEC_alarms_Farrington %>% summarize(nAlarm = sum(alarm)) %>% .$nAlarm` alarms, while the Noufaily method produces a significantly lower count of `r STEC_alarms_Noufaily %>% summarize(nAlarm = sum(alarm)) %>% .$nAlarm` alarms.

The substantial number of alarms generated by both the Farrington method and the Noufaily method raises valid concerns. The sheer volume of alarms can overwhelm epidemiologists, posing challenges in effectively prioritizing and investigating potential outbreaks. It is crucial to avoid reacting solely to individual alarms and instead consider the bigger picture.

Of particular importance are alarms that are triggered simultaneously in multiple age groups or during concurrent time points. Such patterns indicate potential outbreaks that warrant further attention and investigation by epidemiologists. By analyzing and interpreting the alarms in context, epidemiologists can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the outbreak situation and make informed decisions about resource allocation and intervention strategies.

\subsection{Applying the novel outbreak detection algorithm to Shiga toxin (verotoxin)-producing \textit{Escherichia coli}}

The subsequent investigation focuses on the application of the novel outbreak detection algorithm to analyze outbreaks. In this analysis, a rolling window with a width of $k=36$ is selected. The reference values are established using monthly data collected from January 2008 to December 2010. Subsequently, the time series is monitored using data from January 2011 to December 2022.

To identify outbreaks, an observation is classified as such if the one-step ahead random effect $u_{t_1}$ exceeds the upper bound $U_{t_0}$. The upper bound is determined as the 90\% quantile of the distribution of random effects obtained from the second stage model. This threshold helps identify significant deviations in the outbreak intensity.

To ensure effective monitoring, a series of models for the fixed effects are proposed, with each model building upon the previous one. These models aim to capture different aspects of the disease dynamics and improve the accuracy of outbreak detection.

In the initial model, the intensity $\lambda_{it}$ is assumed to be solely dependent on the age group and the population size $n_{it}$. The model is formulated as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Agegroup}
  \log(\lambda_{it}) = \beta(ageGroup_{i}) + \log(n_{it})
\end{equation}

Here, $\beta(ageGroup_{i})$ represents the fixed effect specific to the age group $i$, capturing the age group's influence on the outbreak intensity. The term $\log(n_{it})$ acts as an offset, accounting for the population size at time $t$ for age group $i$.

In the first extension of this initial model, the trend over time across all age groups is incorporated. The extended model is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
  \log(\lambda_{it})=\beta(ageGroup_{i}) + \beta_{trend} t + \log(n_{it})
\end{equation}

In this model, $\beta_{trend}$ quantifies the rate of change in the outbreak intensity over time. By including this parameter, the model accounts for the overall trend in the outbreak intensity across all age groups, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the outbreak dynamics.

In addition to the models described earlier, another model is proposed, which incorporates seasonality into the analysis. This model builds upon the initial model and assumes an annual seasonality pattern. The intensity $\lambda_{it}$ is modeled as follows:

\begin{equation}
\log(\lambda_{it})=\beta(ageGroup_{i})+ \sin \big(\frac{2\pi\cdot \tau_t}{12}\big) \beta_{\sin} + \cos \big(2\frac{\pi\cdot \tau_t}{12}\big) \beta_{\cos} + \log(n_{it})
\end{equation}

In this model, $\tau_t$ represents the time period $t$ within a year, ranging from 1 to 12 (corresponding to the months of January to December). The parameters $\beta_{\sin}$ and $\beta_{\cos}$ capture the effect of the seasonal pattern on the outbreak intensity. By including sine and cosine functions of $\tau_t$, the model accounts for the periodic fluctuations in the outbreak intensity observed throughout the year. This allows for the detection and analysis of seasonality patterns in the outbreak data, providing insights into the seasonal variations in disease occurrence.

In addition to the models described earlier, a final model is proposed that combines both trend and seasonality components. This model builds upon the previous models and includes the effects of both the overall trend over time and the seasonal patterns. The intensity $\lambda_{it}$ is modeled as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:AgegroupTrendSeasonality}
  \log(\lambda_{it})=\beta(ageGroup_{i}) + \beta_{trend} t + \sin \big(\frac{2\pi\cdot \tau_t}{12}\big) \beta_{\sin} + \cos \big(\frac{2\pi\cdot \tau_t}{12}\big)\beta_{\cos} + \log(n_{it})
\end{equation}

The proposed models above are subsequently implemented and estimated in two different modeling frameworks: the hierarchical Poisson Normal model and the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model. The goodness-of-fit of these models is evaluated using the average logarithmic score, $\bar{S}(G,y)$. An excerpt of these results, namely for the models with the lowest logarithmic score, $\bar{S}(G,y)$, for both modeling frameworks, are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:STECNovelTbl). For the full table of results, refer to Table \@ref(tab:STECNovelTblAppendix).

The models incorporating both trends and seasonality have shown improved performance in terms of lower logarithmic scores, indicating a better fit to the data. As a result, these models have been selected for further investigation regarding their ability to detect outbreaks.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the parameter estimates and confidence intervals for the fixed effects are consistent across the two modeling frameworks, despite the differences in assumptions about the distribution of random effects. This suggests that the choice of modeling framework does not have a substantial impact on the estimation of the fixed effects in this analysis.

Figure \@ref(fig:CompareNovelSTEC) shows the one-step ahead random effects $u_{i{t_1}}$ for each age group and the corresponding upper bounds $U_{t_0}$ for both modeling frameworks.

The random effects $u_{i{t_1}}$ represent the deviations from the expected outbreak intensity in the subsequent time period for each age group. These random effects provide information on whether there is an unusual or unexpected increase or decrease in the outbreak intensity compared to the expected values.

The upper bounds $U_{t_0}$ are calculated based on the 90% quantile of the distribution of the random effects obtained from the second stage model. They serve as threshold values to identify potential outbreaks. If the one-step ahead random effects exceed the upper bounds, it suggests a significant deviation from normal variation and indicates a potential outbreak.

By visualizing the one-step ahead random effects and the upper bounds together, epidemiologists can easily identify periods or age groups where the random effects surpass the upper bounds, highlighting potential outbreaks that require further investigation and monitoring.

```

A slight, yet consistent, increase in the contribution from the age group to the overall intensity of STEC cases is observed in Figure \@ref(fig:STECnovelparageGroup) over the analyzed period, with only one instance of a decrease in intensity immediately after the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown.

It is worth noting that in the hierarchical Poisson Gamma framework, the parameter estimate for $\beta(ageGroup_i)$ directly represents the contribution of the age group to the disease intensity. This is possible due to the properties of the expected value described in Equation \eqref{eq:meanNB}. However, this direct interpretation does not hold for the parameter estimates obtained in the hierarchical Poisson Normal framework. Nevertheless, it can be observed that both sets of parameter estimates are similar throughout the entire time period, indicating that this discrepancy is not significant.

\section{\textit{Listeriosis}}

Intuitively, it is not common to employ statistical methods for monitoring and detecting outbreaks of \textit{Listeriosis}. The current state-of-the-art approach for detecting outbreaks of this disease relies on laboratory-based methods, specifically WGS. WGS enables epidemiologists to link cases that have occurred over an extended period, even months or years apart, and identify them as part of a continuous-source outbreak. Statistical methods may face challenges in detecting such outbreaks due to their complex and prolonged nature. However, it is crucial to include this case study in the master's thesis to highlight both the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.

The data set used in this case study consists of monthly counts of Danish listeria cases, denoted as $y_{it}$. The subscript $i$ distinguishes between two age groups, with $i=1$ representing the age group below 65 years and $i=2$ representing the age group above 65 years. The subscript $t$ represents the time period, ranging from $t=1,\cdots,T$, where $T=180$ corresponds to the total number of months starting in 2008.

Both the state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithm and the novel outbreak detection algorithm are applied to this data set.

\subsection{Applying the state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithm to \textit{Listeriosis}}

In Figure \@ref(fig:CompareStateOfTheArtLIST), multiple alarms can be observed for both the Farrington method and the Noufaily method. The Farrington method triggers a total of `r LIST_alarms_Farrington %>% summarize(nAlarm = sum(alarm)) %>% .$nAlarm` alarms, while the Noufaily method produces slightly fewer alarms, specifically `r LIST_alarms_Noufaily %>% summarize(nAlarm = sum(alarm)) %>% .$nAlarm` alarms.

Initially, outbreak detection using the Farrington method and the Noufaily method, described in Section \@ref(StateOfTheArt), are investigated. 


The reference values for the analysis are based on the data from January 2008 to February 2011. Subsequently, surveillance is conducted using the data from March 2011 to December 2021. The resulting series is visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:CompareStateOfTheArtLIST).

Poisson Normal model (right) and Poisson Gamma model (left) monitor the disease. Alarm raised (solid circle) if $u_{t_1}$ exceeds the threshold (dashed line).

knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Compare_stateOfTheArt_LIST.png")
```

Interestingly, both the Farrington method and the Noufaily method demonstrate the ability to correctly raise alarms during ongoing outbreak investigations by SSI. One notable example is the outbreak investigated by SSI, which involved 41 cases and resulted in 17 deaths. The Farrington method successfully flags this event in September 2013, with alarms occurring sporadically in the subsequent period. The Noufaily method also identifies this outbreak, although it does so one month later in October 2013.

It is worth noting that the other observations flagged by the methods may be related to some of the numerous other long-spanned outbreaks that occurred concurrently in the period from 2016 to 2021. However, it is out of scope for this master's thesis, to directly link individual alarms to specific outbreaks.

For a full list over the observations flagged by the state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithms see Table \@ref(tab:LISTStateOfTheArtTbl).

\subsection{Applying the novel outbreak detection algorithm to \textit{Listeriosis}}

The one-step ahead random effects $u_{t_1}$ for the disease are depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:CompareNovelLIST). It is evident that the models struggle to accurately capture the underlying process of the disease. There are prolonged periods where the random effects collapse, indicating that there is insufficient information in the data to inform the model. This is particularly noticeable in the hierarchical Poisson Normal model, where the variance parameter $\sigma$ approaches zero.

However, it is worth noting that both modeling frameworks identify the same observations as outbreaks, all of which coincide with one or more concurrent outbreaks investigated by SSI. The first two observations characterized as outbreaks occur in August and September 2014. The third outbreak is in January 2017, and the last two outbreaks are in June and November 2022.

\section{\textit{Shiggellosis}}

The data set utilized in this case study comprises monthly counts of Danish shigella cases, denoted as $y_{it}$. The subscript $i$ distinguishes between two age groups, with $i = 1$ representing the age group below 25 years and $i = 2$ representing the age group above 25 years. The subscript $t$ represents the time period, ranging from $t = 1,\cdots, T$, where $T = 180$ corresponds to the total number of months starting in 2008.

Both the state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithm and the novel outbreak detection algorithm are applied to this data set.
