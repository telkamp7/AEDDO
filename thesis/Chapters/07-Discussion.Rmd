\chapter{Discussion}

In this chapter, several topics that have not been previously discussed will be addressed. This includes addressing the implications of overly sensitive outbreak detection methods, providing a summary of the considerations when deciding on a modeling framework in the novel method, and exploring the potential of \gls{MiBa}-based surveillance.

\section{Alarm fatigue and the implications for outbreak detection}

The field of automated disease outbreak detection has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with the development of sophisticated statistical methods and the utilization of computerized databases. These advancements have tremendous potential in supplementing epidemiologists and help them effectively prioritize their efforts and allocate resources accordingly, leading to more efficient and targeted outbreak management strategies. However, and emerging concern in the field is the phenomenon known as "alarm fatigue" and its implications for statistical outbreak detection.

Alarm fatigue refers to the desensitization and decreased responsiveness that can occur when epidemiologists are exposed to frequent of excessive alarms from a statistical outbreak detection method. Specifically, the state-of-the-art methods are known for their occasional lack of specificity, leading to false alarms that can overwhelm the epidemiologists with verification tasks. Consequently, their usefulness and practicality in real-world settings are undermined. 


\section{For and against of the two modeling frameworks in the novel method}

The hierarchical Poisson Gamma model offers the advantage of directly interpreting parameter estimates as their actual contribution to disease intensity, thanks to the properties of the resulting negative binomial distribution. In contrast, the hierarchical Poisson Normal model lacks a known expected value for the distribution of $Y|u$, necessitating numerical methods like the Laplace approximation for parameter estimation and inference.

However, despite the differences in assumptions about the distribution of random effects, this master thesis demonstrates that parameter estimates and confidence intervals for the fixed effects model remain consistent across both modeling frameworks. Consequently, the choice between the two frameworks may depend more on data characteristics and computational considerations rather than the interpretation of parameter estimates.

A notable advantage of the hierarchical Poisson Normal model is its ease of extension to incorporate correlation in time or between groups by including a covariance matrix in the second stage model. This extension is relatively straightforward within this framework. In contrast, implementing correlation in the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model is more complex and requires further investigation and research. However, including correlation has the potential to enhance the outbreak detection method's performance and capture additional patterns in the data, as observed in Figures \@ref(fig:ACF) and \@ref(fig:corr) for the \gls{STEC} case study.

Another significant difference between the two modeling frameworks is the run time efficiency. The hierarchical Poisson Gamma model exhibits faster computation, up to a factor of $4\times$ faster, compared to the hierarchical Poisson Normal model. However, it is crucial to note that for the task of outbreak detection, real-time decision-making may not heavily depend on efficient run time. The outbreak detection procedure is typically performed on a weekly basis, minimizing the practical importance of the computational advantages offered by the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model.

\section{Harnessing the potential of MiBa}

In the future, the utilization of \gls{MiBa}-based surveillance has immense potential for disease surveillance. It has already demonstrated its value in various surveillance systems, such as \gls{HAIBA} for monitoring hospital-acquired infections [@Condell_2016; @Gubbels_2017] and the \gls{COVID-19} surveillance system [@Schonning_2021].

\gls{HAIBA}, launched in 2015, was the first fully automated surveillance system built on \gls{MiBa} data. It provides monitoring capabilities for hospital-acquired infections, enabling healthcare professionals to track and manage these infections more effectively. Similarly, the \gls{COVID-19} surveillance system, developed during 2020 and 2021, utilizes \gls{MiBa} data to monitor and respond to the \gls{COVID-19} pandemic.

In addition to these systems, \gls{MiBa}-based surveillance includes monitoring respiratory infections (such as influenza, pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus) and sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia. While these surveillance systems currently have partial automation in data processing, there are plans to fully automate them in the near future.

Expanding on the field of automated disease outbreak detection is crucial to fully harness the potential of \gls{MiBa}. By developing advanced algorithms and methodologies, it becomes possible to automatically analyze \gls{MiBa} data and detect disease outbreaks in a timely manner. This can lead to early identification of outbreaks, allowing for prompt interventions and preventive measures.

This master thesis serves as a proof of concept and can serve as a catalyst for future research and development in automated disease outbreak detection. The focus should be on customizing methods to effectively utilize the valuable \gls{MiBa} data, as this has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of detecting and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. By fully leveraging the capabilities of \gls{MiBa}-based surveillance and continuously improving automated detection methods, the overall disease surveillance efforts can be strengthened, leading to better protection of public health.
