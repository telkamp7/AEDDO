\section{Pros and cons for the different modeling frameworks}

A neat feature of the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model is that the parameter estimates obtained using this modeling framework can be directly interpreted as their actual contribution to the disease intensity. This is possible because of the properties of the resulting distributional model, viz. the negative binomial distribution, of $Y$, where the expected value is exactly equal to $\mathbb{E}[Y]=\lambda$.

On the other hand, the same cannot be said for the hierarchical Poisson Normal model. In this case, the expected value of the distribution of $Y|u$ is unknown, as it is generally not feasible to obtain closed-form solutions for the marginal likelihood. Thus, numerical methods, such as the Laplace approximation, need to be employed to estimate the model parameters and make inferences.

However, it is shown in this master thesis that the parameter estimates and confidence intervals for the fixed effects models are consistent across the two modeling frameworks, despite the differences in assumptions about the distribution of random effects. 

Also, for the purpose of outbreak detection, the fixed effects parameters are considered nuisance parameters. Therefore, the choice between the two modeling frameworks may depend more on the specific characteristics of the data and the computational considerations, rather than on the interpretation of the parameter estimates. 

One notable difference between the two modeling frameworks considered in the novel outbreak detection algorithm is the observed difference in run time. It was shown that the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model offers computational advantages in terms of run time efficiency. The run time for this model was remarkably faster, up to a factor of $3\times$, compared to the hierarchical Poisson Normal model.

This difference in run time is likely attributed to the computational requirements of the Laplace approximation, which is needed in the hierarchical Poisson Normal model. However, it is important to note that for the task at hand, efficient run time may not be the main priority. The outbreak detection procedure is most likely executed on a weekly basis, so the computational advantages of the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model may not be crucial in terms of real-time decision-making.

\section{Harnessing the potential of MiBa}

In the future, the utilization of \gls{MiBa}-based surveillance has immense potential for disease surveillance. It has already demonstrated its value in various surveillance systems, such as \gls{HAIBA} for monitoring hospital-acquired infections [@Condell_2016; @Gubbels_2017] and the \gls{COVID-19} surveillance system [@Schonning_2021].

\gls{HAIBA}, launched in 2015, was the first fully automated surveillance system built on \gls{MiBa} data. It provides monitoring capabilities for hospital-acquired infections, enabling healthcare professionals to track and manage these infections more effectively. Similarly, the \gls{COVID-19} surveillance system, developed during 2020 and 2021, utilizes \gls{MiBa} data to monitor and respond to the \gls{COVID-19} pandemic.

In addition to these systems, \gls{MiBa}-based surveillance includes monitoring respiratory infections (such as influenza, pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus) and sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia. While these surveillance systems currently have partial automation in data processing, there are plans to fully automate them in the near future.

Expanding on the field of automated disease outbreak detection is crucial to fully harness the potential of \gls{MiBa}. By developing advanced algorithms and methodologies, it becomes possible to automatically analyze \gls{MiBa} data and detect disease outbreaks in a timely manner. This can lead to early identification of outbreaks, allowing for prompt interventions and preventive measures.

This master thesis serves as a proof of concept and can serve as a catalyst for future research and development in automated disease outbreak detection. The focus should be on customizing methods to effectively utilize the valuable \gls{MiBa} data, as this has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of detecting and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. By fully leveraging the capabilities of \gls{MiBa}-based surveillance and continuously improving automated detection methods, the overall disease surveillance efforts can be strengthened, leading to better protection of public health.

\section{Potential extensions of the novel algorithm}

An extension of the novel outbreak detection method proposed in this master thesis involves incorporating correlation, either in time or between groups. The \gls{ACF} plot in Figure \@ref(fig:ACF) provides insights into the temporal dependencies and correlations withing the data.

(ref:ACF) \gls{ACF} for the estimated one-step ahead random effects $\hat u_{i{t_0}}$ for the six age groups. The plots are organized in increasing age group, i.e. \textbf{(a)} <1 year, \textbf{(b)} 1-4 years, \textbf{(c)} 5-14 years, \textbf{(d)} 15-24 years, \textbf{(e)} 25-64 years, and \textbf{(f)} 65+ years.

```{r ACF, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="(ref:ACF)", fig.pos = "H", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/ACFplot.png")
```

The \gls{ACF} plot reveals significant autocorrelation at lag 1 across all age groups, indicating a strong temporal dependency. Some age groups, such as 15-24 years, 25-64 years, and 65+ years, exhibit significant autocorrelation at lag 2. Additionally, a notable seasonal autocorrelation is observed at lag 12 in most age groups. These findings suggest the presence of underlying patterns and correlations that can be further explored and leveraged in the development of the outbreak detection method.

The correlation plot in Figure \@ref(fig:corr) provides insights into the intergroup correlation, highlighting potential shared patterns or dependencies across different age groups.

(ref:corr) Correlation of the estimated one-step ahead random effects $\hat u_{i{t_0}}$ for the six age groups.

```{r corr, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="(ref:corr)", fig.pos = "H", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/corrPlot.png")
```

The plot clearly shows a strong intergroup correlation between the age groups, particularly between 5-14 years, 15-24 years, and 25-64 years. This suggests that these age groups may exhibit similar disease patterns or dynamics.

Analyzing the intergroup correlation can provide valuable information for understanding the dynamics and interactions between different age groups. It can help identify commonalities and differences in disease patterns, enabling targeted intervention strategies and efficient resource allocation.

Further exploration and analysis of the intergroup correlation can enhance our understanding of disease dynamics and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the outbreak detection method, leading to better public health outcomes.

To incorporate correlation, either in time or between groups, the hierarchical Poisson Normal model can be extended by including a covariance matrix in the second stage model. This extension is relatively straightforward within this framework. However, implementing correlation in the hierarchical Poisson Gamma model is more complex and requires additional investigation and research to fully comprehend its implications and feasibility. Nevertheless, exploring the inclusion of correlation within the outbreak detection method has the potential to enhance its performance and capture additional patterns in the data.
