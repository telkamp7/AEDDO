\chapter{Introduction} 

The fight against infectious diseases not only requires proper treatment of patients and implementation of preventive measures but also demands early detection of emerging disease outbreaks. Timely identification and intervention can mean the difference between containing an outbreak or facing a devastating epidemic. 

In Denmark, the surveillance of infectious diseases is mainly carried out by \glsfirst{SSI}, which plays a pivotal role in national and international disease preparedness. The high quality of the Danish surveillance registers, facilitated by a robust regulatory community framework, presents a significant opportunity for data analysis and enables timely detection of aberrant case counts. More to, the establishment of \gls{MiBa} by \gls{SSI} in 2010 [@Voldstedlund_2014] has further strengthened the ability to monitor diseases promptly.

In this master thesis, emphasis is placed on diseases caused by foodborne illnesses, as they are often associated with specific food sources and provide an opportunity for intervention and preventive measures. Currently, several approaches are employed at \gls{SSI} to detect outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. These include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Reports from doctors:} Physicians may report cases of foodborne illnesses they encounter in their practice to the relevant authorities.
  \item \textbf{Citizen reports:} Individuals may directly contact food or health authorities to report suspected cases of foodborne illnesses.
  \item \textbf{Cluster identification through laboratory surveillance:} Clusters of cases can be identified through routine laboratory testing and surveillance of samples from patients with suspected foodborne illnesses.
  \item \textbf{Identification of identical "fingerprints":} When bacteria or viruses are type-tested, the presence of identical fingerprints among multiple cases can strongly indicate a common source of infection.
\end{enumerate}

These approaches contribute to the early detection and investigation of infectious disease outbreaks, including foodborne diseases. However, at the time of writing this thesis, there are no automated procedures in place at \gls{SSI}, and the identification of outbreaks relies on the work of individual epidemiologists. Consequently, there is a momentous demand for an automated procedure for the early identification of disease outbreaks. Such a method could effectively guide the work of epidemiologists at \gls{SSI} and other health institutes, enhancing the overall surveillance of infectious diseases at national and international levels.

This master thesis proposes a novel method for automated and early detection of disease outbreaks. The method utilizes hierarchical models in an innovative way, offering an alternative to state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithms. The models are specifically formulated to model the count observations $\boldsymbol y$ and assess the random effects $\boldsymbol u$ in a subset of diseases within the mandatory notification system. Subsequently, the random effects are directly utilized in the detection algorithm to characterize and identify outbreaks.

The main objective of this research is to assess the effectiveness and practicality of automated outbreak detection methods. To achieve this, a comparative analysis is conducted, evaluating the ability of the novel method to detect outbreaks in the case studies. Specifically, this thesis considers case studies of: \gls{LIST}, \gls{SHIL}, \gls{STEC}, and \gls{SALM}. The performance of the proposed method is benchmarked against the methods currently employed at \gls{SSI} as well as state-of-the-art methods identified in the literature.

It is important to highlight that while the case studies in this thesis are disease-specific, the statistical algorithms utilized are not limited to these particular diseases. They can be applied to detect abnormal case counts in any type of disease, enabling early detection and timely response. The versatility of these algorithms allows for their application in various disease surveillance systems, contributing to the enhancement of public health efforts.

In addition to the case studies, a simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the novel outbreak detection algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. The objective is to assess the ability of the automated procedures to timely detect disease outbreaks. By leveraging the potential of hierarchical models, this research seeks to improve the timeliness and accuracy of disease outbreak detection.
