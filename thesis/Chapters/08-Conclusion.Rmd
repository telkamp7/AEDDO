\chapter{Conclusion}

This master thesis aimed to address the potential of automating the early detection of disease outbreaks. The primary objective was to develop a novel method for outbreak detection and compare its performance with established methods from the literature, such as the method proposed by @Farrington_1996 and the improved method by @Noufaily_2013. By utilizing innovative approaches based on hierarchical models, important advancements were achieved in the field of statistical outbreak detection.

The key finding of this study underscores the immense potential of the developed method in automating and detecting disease outbreaks. Through the analysis of various case studies, the novel approach successfully identified anomalous counts coinciding with outbreak investigations conducted by \gls{SSI}. Also, it considerably reduced the number of alarms generated compared to the Farrington and Noufaily methods. Furthermore, in the simulation study, the developed method exhibited a lower \gls{FPR} compared to the Farrington method, but a little higher \gls{FPR} than the Noufaily method, while maintaining a high \gls{POD} for varying sizes of simulated outbreaks.

These findings highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the novel method in accurately detecting disease outbreaks, offering a promising avenue for improving public health surveillance and response systems. By integrating this method into existing public health frameworks, such as \gls{MiBa}, the preparedness and response capabilities can be enhanced, ultimately leading to improved outcomes in disease prevention and control.
