\chapter{Conclusion}

This master thesis aimed to address the potential of automating the early detection of disease outbreaks. The primary objective was to develop a novel method for outbreak detection and compare its performance with established methods from the literature, such as the method proposed by @Farrington_1996 and the improved method by @Noufaily_2013. By utilizing innovative approaches based on hierarchical models, important advancements were achieved in the field of statistical outbreak detection.

The key finding of this study underscores the immense potential of the developed method in automating and detecting disease outbreaks. Through the analysis of various case studies, the novel approach successfully identified anomalous counts coinciding with outbreak investigations conducted by \gls{SSI}. Also, it considerably reduced the number of alarms generated compared to the Farrington and Noufaily methods. 

However, various challenges were encountered while conducting the case studies. Convergence issues were particularly evident in the hierarchical models, especially in the \gls{LIST} case study. These issues are likely attributed to the absence of overdispersion in the data. When overdispersion is lacking, the second stage model is not informed and a Poisson distribution alone can adequately model the data. This makes an approach based on \glspl{GLM} more suitable for these scenarios.

Furthermore, the context in which the model operates should be carefully considered. Sudden decreases or increases in the reported cases should trigger further investigation by epidemiologists, prompting necessary adjustments to the model. Contextual awareness is crucial for optimal outbreak detection performance.

Another vital aspect is handling the presence of previous outbreaks in the disease data. Neglecting to address this appropriately can lead to inflated model parameters and decreased sensitivity of the method. Properly accounting for previous outbreaks ensures more accurate outbreak detection results.

In the simulation study, the developed method exhibited a lower \gls{FPR} compared to the Farrington method but a slightly higher \gls{FPR} than the Noufaily method. Nonetheless, it maintained a high \gls{POD} for varying sizes of simulated outbreaks, indicating its reliability and practicality in real-world scenarios.

Overall, these findings highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the novel method in accurately detecting disease outbreaks, offering a promising avenue for improving public health surveillance and response systems. By integrating this method into existing public health frameworks, such as \gls{MiBa}, the preparedness and response capabilities can be enhanced, ultimately leading to improved outcomes in disease prevention and control.
