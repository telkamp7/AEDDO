\chapter{Conclusion}

This master thesis aimed to address the critical challenge of automating the early detection of disease outbreaks. The primary objective was to develop a novel method for outbreak detection and compare its performance with established methods from the literature, such as the method proposed by @Farrington_1996 and the improved method by @Noufaily_2013. By utilizing innovative approaches based on generalized linear mixed effects models and hierarchical generalized linear models, important advancements were achieved in the field of outbreak detection.

The key finding of this study underscores the immense potential of the developed method in automating and detecting disease outbreaks at an early stage. Through the analysis of various case studies, the novel approach successfully identified anomalous counts coinciding with outbreak investigations conducted by \gls{SSI} and other potential collaborators. Furthermore, in the simulation study, the developed method exhibited a lower \gls{FPR} compared to the method proposed by @Farrington_1996, while maintaining a high \gls{POD} for varying sizes of simulated outbreaks.

These findings highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the novel method in accurately detecting disease outbreaks, offering a promising avenue for improving public health surveillance and response systems. By integrating this method into existing public health frameworks, such as \gls{MiBa}, the preparedness and response capabilities can be enhanced, ultimately leading to improved outcomes in disease prevention and control.
