\section{Hierarchical models}

In this section the hierarchical model and the generalized mixed effect model that is used to model the count observation $y_{it}$ for the specific age groups, $i=1,\dots,11$, and in the monthly period ranging from 2008 to 2022, $t=1,\dots,180$, is presented. For an introduction to the concept of hierarchical models see @Madsen_2010.

\subsection{Hierachical Poisson Normal model}

The conditional distribution of the count observations, $Y|u$, are assuned to be a Poisson distribution with intensities $\lambda_{it}$. Also, we shall assume that the count is proportional to the population size, $x_{it}$, within each age group, $i$, at a given time point, $t$. Hence, in terms of the canonical link for the Poisson distribution the model for the fixed effect is

\begin{equation}
  \log(\lambda_{it}) =\mathbf{X}_i^T \beta_{it} + \log(x_{it})
\end{equation}

Here $\mathbf{X}_i$ is $T\times6\mathrm{-dimensional}$, and $\beta_{it}$ contains the corresponding fixed effect parameters. The random effects $u_it$ are assumed to be Gaussian

\begin{equation}
  u_{it}=\epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_{it}\sim\N(0,\sigma^2)$ and are independent and identically distributed, and $sigma$ is a model parameter. Henceforth, the model can be formulated as a two-level hierarchical model

\begin{subequations} \label{eq:PoisN}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    Y_{it}|u_{it} &\sim \Pois \big( \lambda_{it} \exp(u_{it}) \big) \label{eq:pois_n0} \\ 
    u_{it} &\sim \N(0,\sigma^2) \label{eq:pois_n1}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}



\subsection{Hierarchical Poisson Gamma model}

Likewise, in the compound Poisson-Gamma model the conditional distribution, $Y|u$, of the count observations are assumed to be a Poisson distribution, but this time the intensities, $\lambda_{it}$, are defined as

\begin{equation}
  \log(\lambda_{it}=\mathbf{X}_i^T \beta_{it}+\log(x_{it}))
\end{equation}

Here $\mathbf{X}_i$ is $T\times6\mathrm{-dimensional}$, and $\beta_{it}$ contains the corresponding fixed effect parameters. Additionally, the random effects $u_it$ are assumed to be Gamma distributed. Subsequently, the model can be formulated as a two-level hierarchical model

\begin{subequations} \label{eq:PoisGam}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    Y_{it}|u_{it} &\sim \Pois (\lambda_{i} u_{it}) \label{eq:pois_g0} \\ 
    u_{it} &\sim \G(1/\phi,\phi) \label{eq:pois_g1}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}



In the first stage a random value $u_{it}$ is selected according to a reparameterized Gamma distribution with shape, $1/\phi$, and scale, $\phi$. Hence the mean value of the Gamma distribution is $1$. Moreover, a fixed effect parameter, $\lambda_{it}$, is found for each age group, $i=1,\dots,11$. The $Y$ is generated according to a Poisson distribution with $\lambda_iu_{it}$ as mean value. The the marginal distribution of $Y$ is a negative binomial distribution, $Y\sim\NB\big(1/\phi,1//\lambda\phi+1)\big)$. The probability function for $Y$ is 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:pdfMix}
  \begin{aligned}
    P[Y=y_i]&=g_{Y}(y;\lambda, \phi) \\
    &=\frac{\lambda^{y}}{y!\Gamma(1/\phi)\phi^{1/\phi}}\frac{\phi^{y+1/\phi}\Gamma(y+1/\phi)}{(\lambda \phi + 1)^{y+1/\phi}} \\
    &=\frac{\Gamma(y+1/\phi)}{\Gamma(1/\phi)y!}\frac{1}{(\lambda\phi+1)^{1/\phi}}\bigg(\frac{\lambda\phi}{\lambda\phi+1}\bigg)^{y} \\
    &=\begin{pmatrix} y+1/\phi-1 \\ y \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{(\lambda\phi+1)^{1/\phi}}\bigg(\frac{\lambda\phi}{\lambda\phi+1}\bigg)^{y} \ , \ for \ y = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where we have used the convention

\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix} z\\y \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\Gamma(z+1)}{\Gamma(z+1-y)y!}
\end{equation}

for $z$ real and $y$ integer values. The marginal distribution of $Y$ is a negative binomial distribution, $Y\sim \NB\big(1/\phi,1/(\lambda \phi+1)\big)$. See proof in \ref{probabilityFunctionY}.



\subsubsection{Inference on individual groups}

Consider the compound Poisson Gamma model in \eqref{eq:PoisGam}, and assume that a value $Y=y$ has been observed. Then the conditional distribution of $u$ for given $Y=y$ is a Gamma distribution

Consider the hierarchical Poisson-Gamma model in \eqref{eq:PoisGam}, and assume that a value $Y=y$ has been observed. Then the conditional distribution of $u$ for given $Y=y$ is a Gamma distribution,

\begin{equation}
  u|Y=y\sim \G\big(y+1/\phi,\phi/(\lambda \phi+1)\big)
\end{equation}

with mean

\begin{equation}
  \E[u|Y=y]=\frac{y\phi+1}{\lambda\phi+1}
\end{equation}

and variance

\begin{equation}
  \V[u|Y=y]=\frac{(y \phi^2+\phi)}{(\lambda \phi + 1)^2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Why do we choose the Gamma distribution to represent the variation between days?}

The Gamma distribution is chosen for three simple reasons. First of all, the support of the Gamma distribution, $0<u_{it}<\infty$ conforms to the mean-value space, $\mathcal{M}$ for the Poisson distribution. Secondly, the two-parameter family of Gamma distributions is a rather flexible class of unimodal distribution, ranging from an exponential distribution to a fairly symmetrical distribution on the positive real line. A third reason may be observed in the derivation of the marginal distribution of $Y$. The fact that the kernel $u^{\alpha-1}\exp(-u/\beta)$ of the mixing distribution have the same structure as the kernel $u^y\exp(-u)$ of the likelihood function corresponding to the sampling distribution of $Y$. This feature have the consequence that the integral has a closed form representation in terms of known functions.
