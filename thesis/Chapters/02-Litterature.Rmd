\chapter{Literature}

In recent years there has been a surge in interest for statistical methods for automated and early detection of infectious disease outbreaks. The methodologies ranges the spectrum of statistical methods and includes regression techniques, time series methodology, methods inspired by statistical process control, methods incorporating spatial information, and multivariate outbreaks detection. A review of the aforementioned methods can be found in @Buckeridge_2007 and @Unkel_2012.

Moreover, state-of-the-art methods for aberration detection is presented in @Salmon_2016 and implemented in the R package \textbf{surveillance}, which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveillance/index.html}{\nolinkurl{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveillance/index.html}}. The R package includes methods such as the Farrington method introduced by @Farrington_1996 together with the improvements proposed by @Noufaily_2013. As a Bayesian counterpart to these methods the BODA method presented by @Manitz_2013 allows for easy integration of covariates. Common for these methods are that no accumulation of evidence takes place and they detect aberrations only when the count of the currently monitored timepoint is above the threshold. Another method, which is also implemented in \textbf{surveillance} is the negative binomial cumulative sum of @Hohle_2008 that allows for the detection of sustained shifts by accumulating evidence over several timepoints.
