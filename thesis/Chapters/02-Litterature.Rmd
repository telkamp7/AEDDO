\chapter{Setting the scene}

Outbreak investigations have a long history, dating back to John Snow's iconic removal of the handle of London's Broad Street pump during the cholera epidemic in 1865 [@Tulchinsky_2018]. Indeed, while John Snow's work was groundbreaking for his time, modern disease outbreak investigations require more advanced and sophisticated techniques. Today, epidemiologists and public health professionals utilize a range of tools and methodologies to effectively tackle disease outbreaks. Here, laboratory-based approaches play a crucial role in outbreak investigations and may involve technique such as molecular epidemiology [@Honardoost_2018; @Struelens_2013] and, more recently, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) [@Koeser_2012; @Baldry_2010]. 

However, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in statistical methods for automated and early detection of disease outbreaks. These methodologies encompass various statistical techniques, including regression analysis, time series methodology, methods inspired by statistical process control, approaches incorporating spatial information, and multivariate outbreak detection. A comprehensive review of these methods can be found in studies by @Buckeridge_2007 and @Unkel_2012.

To establish a golden standard, this master thesis will focus on the Farrington method initially introduced by @Farrington_1996 and the subsequent improvement proposed by @Noufaily_2013. These methods offer advanced statistical tools for detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks and are currently \textit{the} methods of choice at European public health institutes [@Hulth_2010] and can be accessed through the R package called \textbf{surveillance} developed by @Salmon_2016.

It is a well known fact, that one limitation of these detection algorithms is an occasional lack of specificity, leading to false alarms that can overwhelm the epidemiologist with verification tasks [@Bedubourg_2017]. Therefore, in this masterÂ´s thesis, these established methods will be compared to a novel outbreak detection algorithm based on generalized mixed effects models and hierarchical generalized linear models respectively. The thesis introduces this new algorithm as an innovative approach to outbreak detection and aims to assess its performance in comparison to already existing methods. 

While generalized linear mixed effects models and hierarchical models have earned a reputation within ecology [@Bolker_2009; @Zuur_2009], urban energy modeling [@Jaume_2022; @Real_2021], and other fields, their application in the automatic detection of disease outbreaks is relatively unproven. However, there is a promising paper by @Heisterkamp_2006 that applied a hierarchical time series model to detect infectious disease outbreaks in empirical data from \textit{Rubella} and \textit{Salmonella}.
