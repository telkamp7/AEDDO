Here is a review of existing methods.

@Farrington_1996 was improved in @Noufaily_2013

and @Salmon_2016

@Shihao_2015 and @Ning_2029 uses Google Search terms to predict influenza-like ilness (ILI).

@Vega_2013 introduces the *Moving Epidemic Method* (MEM), which is used to compare the intensity level of ILI's in @Vega_2015.

An analysis of ILI spread in Sweden showed that, rates in some large countries could vary
considerably from one region to another @Skog_2014.

Different methods for monitoring influenza surveillance using only recent data is presented in @Cowling_2006

@Hutwagner_1997 applied cumulative sums (CUSUM), to detect Salmonella outbreaks in US.

@Costagliola_1991 implement a simple regression model and calculates a 95\% CI for a non-epidemic curve and use this threshold to alert when an epidemic begins.

@Stern_1999 discusses an automated algorithm to detect disease outbreaks with salmonella in Australia
