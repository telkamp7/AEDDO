\chapter{Setting the scene}

Outbreak investigations have a long history, dating back to John Snow's iconic removal of the handle of London's Broad Street pump during the cholera epidemic in 1865 [@Tulchinsky_2018]. Indeed, while John Snow's work was groundbreaking for his time, modern disease outbreak investigations require more advanced and sophisticated techniques. 

Today, epidemiologists and public health professionals utilize a range of tools and methodologies to effectively tackle disease outbreaks. Here, laboratory-based approaches play a crucial role in outbreak investigations and may involve technique such as molecular epidemiology [@Honardoost_2018; @Struelens_2013] and, more recently, \gls{WGS} [@Koeser_2012; @Baldry_2010]. 

However, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in statistical methods for automated and early detection of disease outbreaks. These methodologies encompass various statistical techniques, including regression analysis, time series methodology, methods inspired by statistical process control, approaches incorporating spatial information, and multivariate outbreak detection. A comprehensive review of these methods can be found in studies by @Buckeridge_2007 and @Unkel_2012.

To establish a golden standard, this master thesis will focus on the method initially introduced by @Farrington_1996 and the subsequent improvements proposed by @Noufaily_2013. These methods offer advanced statistical tools for detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks and are currently \textit{the} methods of choice at European public health institutes [@Hulth_2010]. They can be accessed through the R package called \textbf{surveillance} developed by @Salmon_2016. 

It is a well known fact, that one limitation of these detection algorithms is an occasional lack of specificity, leading to false alarms that can overwhelm the epidemiologist with verification tasks [@Bedubourg_2017]. Therefore, in this master thesis, these established methods will be compared to a novel outbreak detection algorithm based on hierarchical models. The thesis introduces this new algorithm as an innovative approach to outbreak detection and aims to assess its performance in comparison to already existing methods.

While hierarchical models have earned a reputation within ecology [@Bolker_2009; @Zuur_2009], urban energy modeling [@Jaume_2022; @Real_2021], and other fields, their application in the automatic detection of disease outbreaks is relatively unproven. However, there is a promising paper by @Heisterkamp_2006 that applied a hierarchical time series model to detect infectious disease outbreaks in empirical data from \textit{Rubella} and \textit{Salmonella}. The authors concluded that the method is a powerful and versatile way of analyzing time series of routinely recorded laboratory data. 

Common to the aforementioned methods is that no accumulation of evidence takes place, and they detect aberrations only when the count of the currently monitored time point is above the threshold. However, not all disease outbreaks are characterized by a sudden increase in the number of reported cases. Specifically, some continuous-source outbreaks may exhibit a small but consistent increase in the number of cases, making them difficult for statistical outbreak detection methods to identify. To address this challenge, a method known as the Negative Binomial cumulative sum was introduced by @Hohle_2008 and is also implemented in the R package \textbf{surveillance}. This method allows for the detection of sustained shifts by accumulating evidence over multiple time points. However, for the purposes of this thesis, the focus will be on the prospective detection of disease outbreaks.
