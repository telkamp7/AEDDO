\chapter{Literature}

In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the interest surrounding statistical methods for automated and early detection of infectious disease outbreaks. These methodologies encompass a wide range of statistical techniques, including regression analysis, time series methodology, methods inspired by statistical process control, approaches incorporating spatial information, and multivariate outbreak detection. A comprehensive review of these methods can be found in @Buckeridge_2007 and @Unkel_2012.

In addition to the aforementioned studies, state-of-the-art methods for aberration detection are presented in @Salmon_2016. These methods have been implemented in the R package called \textbf{surveillance}, which can be accessed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveillance/index.html}{\nolinkurl{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveillance/index.html}}. The \textbf{surveillance} package provides various techniques for detecting aberrations in disease surveillance data, including the Farrington method initially introduced by @Farrington_1996 and subsequent improvements proposed by @Noufaily_2013. These methods offer advanced statistical tools for detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks and are currently \textit{the} method choice at European public health institutes [@Hulth_2010]. 

Therefore, in this master's thesis, these established methods will be compared to a novel outbreak detection algorithm based on generalized mixed effects models and hierarchical generalized linear models respectively. The thesis introduces this new algorithm as an innovative approach to outbreak detection and aims to assess its performance in comparison to existing methods.
