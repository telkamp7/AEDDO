In recent years there has been a surge in interest and development of statistical methods for automated and early detection of infectious disease outbreaks. This growth can largely be attributed to the widespread availability of computerized databases, such as \glsentrylong{MiBa}. The accessibility of these databases has provided a wealth of data that can be analyzed, facilitating the use of statistical outbreak detection methods.

However, at the time of writing this thesis, there are no fully automated detection procedures in place at \gls{SSI}, and the identification of outbreaks relies on the work of individual epidemiologists. Consequently, there is a momentous demand for an automated procedure for the early identification of disease outbreaks.

This thesis presents the development of a novel method for automated and early detection of disease outbreaks, with a focus on comparing its performance to state-of-the-art methods from the literature and the methods currently employed at \gls{SSI}. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its potential for improving outbreak detection.

The methodology employed in the novel method centers around an innovative utilization of generalized linear mixed effects models and hierarchical generalized linear models. These models offer a robust framework for capturing the underlying dynamics of disease spread and allow for the incorporation of various covariates and random effects.

Through case studies involving foodborne illnesses, including \glsentrylong{LIST}, \glsentrylong{SHIL}, \glsentrylong{STEC}, and \glsentrylong{SALM}, as well as a simulation study, the key findings of this research highlight the promising potential of the novel method. The developed approach demonstrates good performance in detecting disease outbreaks compared to established methods, including the Farrington method and the subsequently improved Noufaily method. Moreover, it effectively controls the number of "false alarms", thereby enhancing the reliability of the outbreak detection method.
