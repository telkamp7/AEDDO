I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisors, Lasse Engbo Christiansen and Jan Kloppenborg Møller, for their invaluable guidance, support, and expertise throughout the entire process of conducting my master thesis. Their extensive knowledge, insightful feedback, and dedication have been instrumental in shaping the direction and quality of this research.

Lasse Engbo Christiansen's exceptional guidance and expertise in mathematical modeling have been crucial in providing me with a solid foundation and understanding of the subject matter. His valuable insights, constructive criticism, and attention to detail have immensely contributed to the development of this thesis. Furthermore, Lasse facilitated my project and provided me with the best possible opportunity to succeed with my master thesis by offering me a work desk at Statens Serum Institut.

I am deeply grateful to Jan Kloppenborg Møller for his continuous support and mentorship. His vast experience with hierarchical models and their application has been a huge asset to this project. His guidance in refining research methodologies, analyzing data, and interpreting results has been invaluable.

I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to both supervisors for their patience, encouragement, and willingness to dedicate their time and expertise to help me overcome challenges and achieve the objectives of this research. Their unwavering support and belief in my abilities have been a constant source of motivation throughout this journey.

I would also like to acknowledge the \sectiondescriber under the \departmentdescriber at the \universitydescriber, and the Department of Epidemiology Research / Model group at Statens Serum Institut for providing a conducive environment for research and for the resources that have facilitated the completion of this thesis.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my family, friends, and loved ones for their unwavering support, understanding, and encouragement throughout this endeavor. I am especially grateful to my wife, Cecilia Schou Telkamp, who, aside from providing me with endless support, listening to all my complaints, and hosting several reading sessions, has also raised our two oldest daughters and given me the beautiful gift of a newborn boy during this period of conducting my thesis.
