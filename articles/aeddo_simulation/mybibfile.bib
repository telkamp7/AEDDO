abstract = {Public health agencies and other groups have invested considerable resources in automated surveillance systems over the last decade. These systems generally follow syndromes in pre-diagnostic data drawn from sources such as emergency department visits. A main goal of syndromic surveillance systems is to detect outbreaks rapidly and the number of studies evaluating outbreak detection has increased recently. This paper reviews these studies with the goal of identifying the determinants of outbreak detection in automated syndromic surveillance systems. The review identified 35 studies with 22 studies (63\%) relying on naturally occurring outbreaks and 13 studies (37\%) relying on simulated outbreaks. In general, the results from these studies suggest that syndromic surveillance systems are capable of detecting some types of disease outbreaks rapidly with high sensitivity. The determinants of detection included characteristics of the system and of the outbreak. Influential system characteristics included representativeness, the outbreak detection algorithm, and the specificity of the algorithm. Important outbreak characteristics included the magnitude and shape of the signal and the timing of the outbreak. Future evaluations should aim to address inconsistencies in the evidence noted in this review and to identify the potential influence of other factors on outbreak detection.}

abstract  = {In England and Wales, a large-scale multiple statistical
            surveillance system for infectious disease outbreaks has been in
            operation for nearly two decades. This system uses a robust
            quasi-Poisson regression algorithm to identify abberrances in
            weekly counts of isolates reported to the Health Protection
            Agency. In this paper, we review the performance of the system
            with a view to reducing the number of false reports, while
            retaining good power to detect genuine outbreaks. We undertook
            extensive simulations to evaluate the existing system in a range
            of contrasting scenarios. We suggest several improvements
            relating to the treatment of trends, seasonality, re-weighting
            of baselines and error structure. We validate these results by
            running the existing and proposed new systems in parallel on
            real data. We find that the new system greatly reduces the
            number of alarms while maintaining good overall performance and
            in some instances increasing the sensitivity.},

 abstract={Public health surveillance aims at lessening disease burden by, e.g., timely recognizing emerging outbreaks in case of infectious diseases. Seen from a statistical perspective, this implies the use of appropriate methods for monitoring time series of aggregated case reports. This paper presents the tools for such automatic aberration detection offered by the R package surveillance. We introduce the functionalities for the visualization, modeling and monitoring of surveillance time series. With respect to modeling we focus on univariate time series modeling based on generalized linear models (GLMs), multivariate GLMs, generalized additive models and generalized additive models for location, shape and scale. Applications of such modeling include illustrating implementational improvements and extensions of the well-known Farrington algorithm, e.g., by spline-modeling or by treating it in a Bayesian context. Furthermore, we look at categorical time series and address overdispersion using beta-binomial or Dirichlet-multinomial modeling. With respect to monitoring we consider detectors based on either a Shewhart-like single timepoint comparison between the observed count and the predictive distribution or by likelihoodratio based cumulative sum methods. Finally, we illustrate how surveillance can support aberration detection in practice by integrating it into the monitoring workflow of a public health institution. Altogether, the present article shows how well surveillance can support automatic aberration detection in a public health surveillance context.},

abstract = {Abstract The purpose of infectious disease surveillance is to inform the public health policy makers on the incidence and trends of infectious diseases and to trigger appropriate actions to control infectious disease outbreaks. The enormous amount of data collected with automated laboratory-based surveillance systems require automated algorithms for detecting unexpected aberrations that may signal infectious disease outbreaks. In this paper, we explore the potential of hierarchical time series models to detect deviations from expected incidence. As these count data are extremely noisy it can be expected that these models are suitable to detect signal from noise and accommodate for possible autocorrelation. The proposed procedure consists of three steps; (1) the model parameters are estimated by empirical Bayes on a training period of, e.g. a year; (2) the expected values are updated for small time steps (e.g. daily) as new data arrive; (3) threshold levels are updated conditionally on the past expected values and an alarm is triggered when the threshold level is exceeded. To test the potential of the models we estimated sensitivity, specificity and timeliness on simulated time series and compared the results with an alternative approach of a linear regression model adjusted for trends and season. We also used two observed series for Rubella notifications and Salmonella infections and compared our findings with the expert opinions on these series. The hierarchical time series models approach shows high sensitivity and specificity and correctly identifies outbreaks at an early stage. This, in our opinion, makes the proposed model a reliable tool for adequate automated detection of infectious disease outbreaks. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {We consider hierarchical generalized linear models which allow extra error components in the linear predictors of generalized linear models. The distribution of these components is not restricted to be normal; this allows a broader class of models, which includes generalized linear mixed models. We use a generalization of Henderson's joint likelihood, called a hierarchical or h-likelihood, for inferences from hierarchical generalized linear models. This avoids the integration that is necessary when marginal likelihood is used. Under appropriate conditions maximizing the h-likelihood gives fixed effect estimators that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the use of marginal likelihood; at the same time we obtain the random effect estimates that are asymptotically best unbiased predictors. An adjusted profile h-likelihood is shown to give the required generalization of restricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of dispersion components. A scaled deviance test for the goodness of fit, a model selection criterion for choosing between various dispersion models and a graphical method for checking the distributional assumption of random effects are proposed. The ideas of quasi-likelihood and extended quasi-likelihood are generalized to the new class. We give examples of the Poisson-gamma, binomial-beta and gamma-inverse gamma hierarchical generalized linear models. A resolution is proposed for the apparent difference between population-averaged and subject-specific models. A unified framework is provided for viewing and extending many existing methods.},

In spite of the immense amount of fruitful labour which has been expended in its practical applications, the basic principles of this organ of science are still in a state of obscurity, and it cannot be denied that, during the recent rapid development of practical methods, fundamental problems have been ignored and fundamental paradoxes left unresolved. This anomalous state of statistical science is strikingly exemplified by a recent paper entitled "The Fundamental Problem of Practical Statistics," in which one of the most eminent of modern statisticians presents what purports to be a general proof of BAYES' postulate, a proof which, in the opinion of a second statistician of equal eminence, "seems to rest upon a very peculiar -- not to say hardly supposable -- relation." }
